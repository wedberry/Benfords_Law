Author: Edward Berry

This project was assigned in CMS 230: Computer Organization and Architecture

The goal of this project was to demonstrate understanding of strings, command line inputs, and built-in C functions. 
The project consists of two parts: 
  1) Validation of Benford's Law against real-world Census data
  2) Writing a program to generate randomized integers that obey Benford's Law.
